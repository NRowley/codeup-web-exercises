    // You are given an array of runner objects, where each object represents a
    // runner with properties name, age, and lapTimes (in seconds). Write a
    // function called getTopRunners that takes the runners array as input and
    // returns an array of top runners. A runner is considered top if their
    // average lap time is 50 seconds or faster. If there are no top runners in
    // the input array, the function should return an empty array
    // HINT: You might want to create a function called calculateLapTimeAverage
    // that takes in an array of numbers and returns the average
    // Input:

    const runners = [
        {name: "Alice", age: 25, lapTimes: [50.5, 45.2, 48.8, 47.1]},
        {name: "Bob", age: 28, lapTimes: [55.2, 50.7, 53.3, 52.9]},
        {name: "Charlie", age: 24, lapTimes: [48.9, 46.3, 50.1, 49.5]},
        {name: "David", age: 27, lapTimes: [51.4, 50.2, 49.8, 52.3]},
        {name: "Eve", age: 26, lapTimes: [47.7, 45.9, 46.6, 48.3]},
    ];
    // Expected Output:
    [
        {name: 'Alice', age: 25, lapTimes: [50.5, 45.2, 48.8, 47.1]},
        {name: 'Charlie', age: 24, lapTimes: [48.9, 46.3, 50.1, 49.5]},
        {name: 'Eve', age: 26, lapTimes: [47.7, 45.9, 46.6, 48.3]}
    ]

    function lapAverage(runner) {
        let averageTime = 0;
        for (let i = 0; i < runner.lapTimes.length; i++) {
            averageTime = averageTime + runner.lapTimes[i];
        }
        averageTime = averageTime / (runner.lapTimes.length)
        return averageTime;
    }

    function getTopRunners(runners) {
        let topRunners = [];
        for (let i = 0; i < runners.length; i++) {
            if (lapAverage(runners[i]) <= 50) {
                topRunners.push(runners[i]);
            }
        }
        return topRunners;
    }

    console.log(getTopRunners(runners));

    // BONUS: Each runner in the resulting array should be represented as an
    // object containing only the name and age properties.

    // Expected Bonus Output:
    [
        {name: "Alice", age: 18},
        {name: "Charlie", age: 19},
        {name: "Eve", age: 17}
