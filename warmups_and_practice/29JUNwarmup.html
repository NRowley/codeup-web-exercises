Write a function that takes a neighborhood object and determines if it is desirable. A neighborhood is desirable.
If the median home price is less than 300000, crime rates are low, and the total rating of schools is at least 24.
The function should return true if the neighborhood object is desirable and false otherwise.

<script>
// example data...

          const neighborhood1 = {
    neighborhood: "Lovely Estates",
    medianHomePrice: 280000,
    pool: true,
    tennis: false,
    crimeRate: "low",
    schools: 22
  };

  const neighborhood2 = {
    neighborhood: "Luminous Estates",
    medianHomePrice: 270000,
    pool: true,
    tennis: false,
    crimeRate: "high",
    schools: 24
  }

  const neighborhood3 = {
    neighborhood: "Oak Mountain",
    medianHomePrice: 290000,
    pool: false,
    tennis: false,
    crimeRate: "low",
    schools: 24
  }

  const neighborhood4 = {
    neighborhood: "Ginormous Acres",
    medianHomePrice: 350000,
    pool: true,
    tennis: true,
    crimeRate: "low",
    schools: 27
  }

  // function desire(nb) {
  //   if (nb.medianHomePrice < 300000 && nb.crimeRate === "low" && nb.schools >= 24) {
  //     return true;
  //   } else {
  //     return false;
  //   }
  // }

//sometimes if statements aren't necessary when looking to return True/False.
function desire(nb) {
  return nb.medianHomePrice < 300000 && nb.crimeRate === "low" && nb.schools >= 24;
